class InstanceData(CSRData):
    """Child class of CSRData to simplify some common operations
    dedicated to instance labels clustering. In particular, this data
    structure stores the cluster-object overlaps: for each cluster (i.e.
    segment, superpoint, node in the superpoint graph, etc), we store
    all the object instances with which it overlaps. Concretely, for
    each cluster-object pair, we store:
      - `obj`: the object's index
      - `count`: the number of points in the cluster-object overlap
      - `y`: the object's semantic label

    Importantly, each object in the InstanceData is expected to be
    described by a unique index in `obj', regardless of its actual
    semantic class. It is not required for the object instances to be
    contiguous in `[0, obj_max]`, although enforcing it may have
    beneficial downstream effects on memory and I/O times. Finally,
    when two InstanceData are batched in an InstanceBatch, the `obj'
    indices will be updated to avoid collision between the batch items.

    :param pointers: torch.LongTensor
        Pointers to address the data in the associated value tensors.
        `values[Pointers[i]:Pointers[i+1]]` hold the values for the ith
        cluster. If `dense=True`, the `pointers` are actually the dense
        indices to be converted to pointer format.
    :param obj: torch.LongTensor
        Object index for each cluster-object pair. Assumes there are
        NO DUPLICATE CLUSTER-OBJECT pairs in the input data, unless
        'dense=True'.
    :param count: torch.LongTensor
        Number of points in the overlap for each cluster-object pair.
    :param y: torch.LongTensor
        Semantic label the object for each cluster-object pair. By
        definition, we assume the objects to be SEMANTICALLY PURE. For
        that reason, we only store a single semantic label for objects,
        as opposed to superpoints, for which we want to maintain a
        histogram of labels.
    :param dense: bool
        If `dense=True`, the `pointers` are actually the dense indices
        to be converted to pointer format. Besides, any duplicate
        cluster-obj pairs will be merged and the corresponding `count`
        will be updated.

        Other kwargs will be ignored.

        while `y < 0` AND `y >= num_classes` ARE VOID LABELS.
        This applies to both `Data.y` and `Data.obj.y`.

        More precisely, we remove from IoU and metrics computation:
          - predictions (i.e. clusters here) containing more than 50% of
            'void' points
          - targets (i.e. objects here) containing more than 50% of
            'void' points. In our case, we assume targets to be
            SEMANTICALLY PURE, so we remove a target even if it contains
            a single 'void' point

        To this end, the present function returns:
          - `cluster_mask`: boolean mask of the clusters containing more
            than 50% points with `void` labels
          - `pair_mask`: boolean mask of the cluster-object pairs whose
            object (i.e. target) has an `void` label
          - `pair_cropped_count`: tensor of cropped target size, for
            each pair. Indeed, blindly removing the predictions with 50%
            or more void points will affect downstream IoU computation.
            To account for this, this, `pair_cropped_count` is intended
            to be used at IoU computation time, when assessing the
            prediction and target sizes

        NB: by construction, removing pairs in `pair_mask` from the
            InstanceData will also remove all target objects containing
            'void' points. Importantly, this assumes, however, that the
